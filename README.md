# MERN Stack Capstone Project

This assignment focuses on designing, developing, and deploying a comprehensive full-stack MERN application that showcases all the skills you've learned throughout the course.

## Assignment Overview

You will:
1. Plan and design a full-stack MERN application
2. Develop a robust backend with MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js
3. Create an interactive frontend with React.js
4. Implement testing across the entire application
5. Deploy the application to production

## Getting Started

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment
2. Clone the repository to your local machine
3. Follow the instructions in the `Week8-Assignment.md` file
4. Plan, develop, and deploy your capstone project

## Files Included

- `Week8-Assignment.md`: Detailed assignment instructions

## Requirements

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or Atlas account)
- npm or yarn
- Git and GitHub account
- Accounts on deployment platforms (Render/Vercel/Netlify/etc.)

## Project Ideas

The `Week8-Assignment.md` file includes several project ideas, but you're encouraged to develop your own idea that demonstrates your skills and interests.

## Submission

Your project will be automatically submitted when you push to your GitHub Classroom repository. Make sure to:

1. Commit and push your code regularly
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Deploy your application and add the live URL to your README.md
4. Create a video demonstration and include the link in your README.md

1. Plan & Design Your Application
🔍 Step 1: Choose a Realistic App Idea
Some example ideas:

Task Manager (To-do app with deadlines & priorities)

Recipe Book (Users add, view, rate, and search recipes)

Expense Tracker (Track income, expenses, and generate reports)

Blog Platform (Users can post, comment, and like articles)

✍️ Step 2: Define Requirements
Write a basic spec including:

User stories: "As a user, I can register and log in"

Features:

Authentication (register/login)

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

User roles (optional)

Data Models:
Example:

js
Copy
Edit
// For a Task Manager
User: { username, email, password }
Task: { title, description, dueDate, status, userId }
🎨 Step 3: Design the UI
Tools: Figma, Wireframes, or hand-drawn

Pages: Login, Dashboard, Item List, Item Details, Admin Panel (if any)

⚙️ 2. Backend: MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js
🧱 Folder Structure
pgsql
Copy
Edit
server/
├── models/
├── routes/
├── controllers/
├── middleware/
├── config/
└── server.js
🛠 Key Features
Authentication: JWT + bcrypt

Routing: RESTful API (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

Database: MongoDB with Mongoose

Middleware: Error handling, auth verification

Validation: Express-validator or Joi

🔋 Example Stack
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install express mongoose cors dotenv bcryptjs jsonwebtoken
🎨 3. Frontend: React.js
⚛️ Folder Structure

│   ├── pages/
│   ├── context/
│   ├── services/
│   └── App.js
🔌 Key Tools
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install axios react-router-dom
📦 Core Concepts
State management: React Context or Redux

Routing: react-router-dom

API Communication: Axios

Authentication: Token-based login persistence

🧪 4. Testing
Backend:
Jest + Supertest for API testing

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install --save-dev jest supertest
Frontend:
React Testing Library

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
What to test:
Authentication (login/signup)

CRUD endpoints

Component rendering

Button clicks, form input, navigation

☁️ 5. Deployment
🛠 Backend (Node/Express):
Deploy to Render, Railway, or Heroku

Use MongoDB Atlas for database hosting

🌐 Frontend:
Use Netlify, Vercel, or host on Render

🔄 CORS Setup (if deployed separately)
In server.js:

js
Copy
Edit
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors({ origin: 'https://your-frontend-url.com' }));
